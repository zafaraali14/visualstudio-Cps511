CPS511 Assignment 1 Skeleton Code

main.c: Contains the main() function, setups OpenGL and draws, does keyboard/mouse handling etc. This is where you should add your submarine/dirigible drawing & animation code.

Vector3D.c/h: A C module for 3D vector operations like addition, scalar multiplication, cross-product etc.

QuadMesh.c/h: Creates a flat open surface mesh of quadrilaterals for you. It has functions to create and draw a mesh, create normal vectors etc. See main.c for an example of how to use these functions. This is a good example of polygon mesh code and we will be learning more about polygon mesh data structures in a couple of weeks. 

CubeMesh.c/h: C code that defines a simple 6-sided cube mesh (unused by the rest of the code).
